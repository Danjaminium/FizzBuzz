FizzBuzz

3 iterations of FizzBuzz
- Basic hardcoded 3,5,15 using if/else
- Dynamic version which can have custom conditions loaded, or use a default 3,5,15
- Dynamic version which uses reflection to get the output from the matching condition object

Conditions can be set in Program.cs, this could be set using a db/input from a user etc. in a real world environment.
